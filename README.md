# ActivatEd

ActivatEd is a web-based application that is designed to assist teachers in the creation and implementation of activators/Do-Nows. Activators are a learning technique used in the beginning of a lesson that is multipurpose; they are utilized as a routined activity that activates a studentâ€™s thinking about content whether that be tapping into prior knowledge or reviewing a topic presented in a previous lesson. ActivatEd solves a facet of this problem, allowing teachers to pre-create their activators and store them to be released to students at a certain time.
